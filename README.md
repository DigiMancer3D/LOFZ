# Lights Out Flipper Zero (LOFZ)

**Lights Out Flipper Zero (LOFZ)** is a Star Wars-inspired puzzle game for the Flipper Zero, based on the classic "Lights Out" game. As the last Jedi, you must toggle a 17-cell grid of lights to turn them all off, battling the evil Sith Lord Flipper Zero, who floods the galaxy with light. Built with AI assistance from Copilot and Grok 3 (xAI), this game evolved from a JavaScript prototype showcasing Bi-Sectional Diffusion Models in a 17-cell grid to a polished C implementation for Flipper Zero.

## Lore
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... The evil Flipper Zero, Sith Lord, has covered the galaxy in light! No one has slept in ages. You are the last Jedi, and your mission is to turn the lights out and vanquish Flipper! Use the D-pad to move and OK to select. The Back button (2x+) exits. The game goal: turn all boxes dark. If all tiles are lit, the Sith wins. May the Force be with you!

## Features
- **Lights Out Puzzle**: Toggle a 4x4 grid (plus an offset block) to turn all cells off. Toggling a cell flips it and its neighbors; the offset block affects four specific cells.
- **AI Opponent**: Sith Lord Flipper Zero makes strategic moves, choosing lit cells closest to your cursor, with 1-4 moves per turn based on a sequence.
- **Star Wars Aesthetic**: Features a scrolling intro crawl, a 16x16 Sith Flipper mascot (1bpp bitmap) that bounces or moves under stress (<20% cells off or score > 981), and thematic win/loss screens.
- **Special Screens**:
  - **Win Screen**: "Victory! The Jedi Triumph!" on success.
  - **Dead Screen**: "You Died! Flipper Wins!" if all cells lit.
  - **Mischief Screen**: "I solemnly swear I'm up to no good!" with a Marauder’s Map vibe.
  - **Secret Code Screen**: Lists input sequences for special screens.
  - **Leaderboard Screen**: Shows top 10 scores (wins and flips).  *Currently doesn't corretly save the data to the file*.

- **UI Enhancements**: 3D-effect board, scrolling Flipper phrases (e.g., "Flipper is Thinking..."), fade transitions, and score/wins display.
- **Audio Toggle**: Enable/disable audio with 3 Left presses (audio not implemented).
- **Secret Codes**: 9-button sequences unlock special screens (see Controls).
- **Optimized for Flipper Zero**: Runs at ~40 FPS, using Furi APIs for GUI, input, and storage on a 128x64 display.
